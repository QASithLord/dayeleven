	<h1>Positioning Properties</h1>
	<p>HTML elements by default, take up the full width of the page. We can keep elements from sitting on top of each other by using positioning properties. There are <strong>four</strong> possible values.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>block</strong>: will not let anything sit next to it on the page, and takes up the full width. It makes the element a block box.</li>
		<li><strong>inline-block</strong>: this also makes the element a block box, but will allow other elements to sit next to it on the same line. </li>
		<li><strong>inline</strong>: makes the element sit on the same line as another element. It will not format it like a block. Additionally, it only tkaes up as much width as needed (not the whole line). Best suited for HTML elements that are blocks by default, such as headers and paragraphs.</li>
		<li><strong>none</strong>: This will make the element and its content disappear from the page</li>
	</ol>
